## How to read this tutorial

This tutorial is meant to be interactive. Each section will get us one step
closer to building a sample application that uses Dagger. We have code snippets
to show you exactly what is happening and we encourage you to type it yourself
on your machine. You can also view the code directly on GitHub. You should be
able to run the application at the end of each section, and we encourage you to
do so. If you feel like you are getting the hang of things, make some changes
and try something of your own!

Some sections have a **Concepts** section at the end to further explain the
ideas introduced in the section.
