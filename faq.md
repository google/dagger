# [`@Binds`]

## Why is `@Binds` different from `@Provides`?

`@Provides`, the most common construct for configuring a binding, serves three
functions:

1.  Declare which type (possibly qualified) is being provided — this is the
    return type
2.  Declare dependencies — these are the method parameters
3.  Provide an implementation for exactly _how_ the instance is provided —
     this is the method body

While the first two fuctions are unique and critical to _every_ `@Provides`
method, the third can often be tedious and repetitive. So, whenever there is a
`@Provides` whose implementation is simple and common enough to be inferred by
Dagger, it makes sense to just declare that as a method without a body (an
abstract method) and have Dagger apply the behavior.

But, if we were to just say that abstract `@Provides` methods should be treated
as we do for `@Binds` methods, the specification of `@Provides` would basically
be two specifications with a bunch of conditional logic.  For example, a
`@Provides` method can have any number of parameters of any type, but a `@Binds`
method can only have a single parameter whose type is assignable to the return
type.  Separating those specifications makes it easier to reason about
correctness because the annotation determines the constraints.

<h2>Why can't I put [`@Binds`] methods and instance [`@Provides`] methods in
    the same module?</h2>

Because `@Binds` methods are _just_ a method _declaration_, they are expressed
as `abstract` methods — no implementation is ever created and nothing is never
invoked. On the other hand, a `@Provides` method _does_ have an implmentation
and _will_ be invoked.

Since `@Binds` methods are never implemented, no concrete class is ever created
that implements those methods.  However, instance `@Provides` methods _require_
a concrete class in order to construct an instance on which the method can be
invoked.

### What do I do instead?

The easiest change is to make the provides method `static`.  In addition to
being compatible with `@Binds`, they often perform better than instance provides
methods.

If the method _must_ be an instance method (e.g. returns a value from a field),
the easiest fix is to separate your `@Provides` methods and `@Binds` methods
into two separate modules and include one from the other.  A simple example that
provides an `HttpServletRequest` and binds `ServletRequest` might look like:

```java
@Module(includes = Declarations.class)
final class HttpServletRequestModule {
  @Module
  interface Declarations {
    @Binds ServletRequest bindServletRequest(HttpServletRequest httpRequest);
  }

  private final HttpServletRequest httpRequest;

  HttpServletRequestModule(HttpServletRequest httpRequest) {
    this.httpRequest = httpRequest;
  }
}
```
