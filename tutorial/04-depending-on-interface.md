title: Depending on an interface
---

But wait: why does `CommandRouter`'s constructor need a `HelloWorldCommand`
specifically? Shouldn't it be able to use any kind of `Command`?

Let's instead specify `CommandRouter`'s dependency as a plain `Command`:

```java
@Inject
CommandRouter(Command command) {
  ...
}
```

But now Dagger doesn't know how to get an instance of `Command`. If you try to
compile, Dagger reports an error. Since `Command` is an _interface_ and can't
have an [`@Inject`] constructor, we need to give Dagger more information.

To do that, we can write a method annotated with [`@Binds`]:

```java
@Module
abstract class HelloWorldModule {
  @Binds
  abstract Command helloWorldCommand(HelloWorldCommand command);
}
```

This [`@Binds`] method tells Dagger that when something depends on a `Command`,
Dagger should provide a `HelloWorldCommand` object in its place. Notice that the
return type of the method, `Command`, is the type that Dagger now knows how to
provide, and the parameter type is the type that Dagger knows to use when
something depends on `Command`.

The method is abstract because just its declaration is enough to tell Dagger
what to do. Dagger does not actually call this method or provide an
implementation for it.

Notice that the [`@Binds`] method is declared in a type that's annotated with
[`@Module`]. Modules are collections of binding methods (methods annotated with
[`@Binds`] or a few other annotations as we'll see later) that give Dagger
instructions on how to provide instances. Unlike [`@Inject`], which goes
directly on a class's constructor, [`@Binds`] methods must be inside a module.

To tell Dagger to look for that [`@Binds`] method in `HelloWorldModule`, we add
it to the [`@Component`] annotation.

```java
@Component(modules = HelloWorldModule.class)
interface CommandRouterFactory {
  CommandRouter router();
}
```

> **Aside:** You might be wondering why it is that we don't need a [`@Module`]
> to tell Dagger about the [`@Inject`]-annotated classes we need as well. The

> `CommandRouter`, it's the return type of the `CommandRouterFactory`'s entry

> transitively when looking at `CommandRouter`.

Now when Dagger looks to create a `CommandRouter` and sees that it needs a
`Command`, it will use the instructions in `HelloWorldModule` to create one.

With this change, our application should continue to work just like it did
before, but our `CommandRouter` class is no longer forced to only work with one
kind of `Command`.
