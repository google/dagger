To explain how to use Dagger, we will build a command line
[ATM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine) application. It
will accept commands on the command line like "deposit 20", "withdraw 10" and
track the balance of accounts.

Let's start with building the shell of this application, first without Dagger.
If some aspects appear to be overly complicated, bear with us, as Dagger starts
to show its power once applications grow larger.

First, we'll create a `Command` interface for each of the possible textual
commands that the ATM can handle.

```java
/** Logic to process some user input. */
interface Command {
  /**
   * String token that signifies this command should be selected (e.g.:
   * "deposit", "withdraw")
   */
  String key();

  /** Process the rest of the command's words and do something. */
  Status handleInput(List<String> input);

  enum Status {
    INVALID,
    HANDLED
  }
}
```

And we'll create a `CommandRouter` that can collect multiple `Command`s and
route input strings to them based on the first word in the input. To start,
we'll give it an empty map of commands.

```java
final class CommandRouter {
  private final Map<String, Command> commands = Collections.emptyMap();

  Status route(String input) {
    List<String> splitInput = split(input);
    if (splitInput.isEmpty()) {
      return invalidCommand(input);
    }

    String commandKey = splitInput.get(0);
    Command command = commands.get(commandKey);
    if (command == null) {
      return invalidCommand(input);
    }

    Status status =
        command.handleInput(splitInput.subList(1, splitInput.size()));
    if (status == Status.INVALID) {
      System.out.println(commandKey + ": invalid arguments");
    }
    return status;
  }

  private Status invalidCommand(String input) {
    System.out.println(
        String.format("couldn't understand \"%s\". please try again.", input));
    return Status.INVALID;
  }

  // Split on whitespace
  private static List<String> split(String string) {  ...  }
}
```

Finally, we'll create a main method:

```java
class CommandLineAtm {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    CommandRouter commandRouter = new CommandRouter();

    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
      commandRouter.route(scanner.nextLine());
    }
  }
}
```

Congratulations! We now have a working command line ATM! It doesn't do anything
just yet, but very soon we'll change that.
