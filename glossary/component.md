## Status: DRAFT

## Definition:

A _component_ is an abstract type that specifies the [entry point]s and
[modules] that define the [binding graph].

Components form a tree: There is one _root component_, and any component can
have any number of child _[subcomponent]s_. A root component is annotated with
[`@Component`] or [`@ProductionComponent`]. A subcomponent is annotated with
[`@Subcomponent`] or [`@ProductionSubcomponent`] and can be instantiated only
within a parent component instance.

Dagger generates an implementation of each component in the tree.

A component is the equivalent of the "injector" in Guice and other
[dependency injection] frameworks.
