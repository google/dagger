title: Glossary: _Binding Method_
---

## Status: DRAFT

## Definition:

A _binding method_ is a method that specifies a [binding]. It must be annotated
with one of the following:

*   [`@Provides`]
*   [`@Produces`]
*   [`@Binds`]
*   [`@BindsOptionalOf`]
*   [`@Multibinds`]
*   [`@BindsInstance`]

All of these methods must be in a [module], except for methods annotated with
[`@BindsInstance`], which appear in a [component builder].

<!-- I don't think we consider @Inject constructors to be binding methods.
     Do we? -->
